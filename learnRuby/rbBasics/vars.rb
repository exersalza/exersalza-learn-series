# Variables are Simple, ruby is dynamically typed like Python

# Ruby uses at the Beginning of each variable a lowercase format
# when you want to do more than one word inside an variable name, you should use underlines
#
# The convention says that a variable starts with an underline or a Letter and can end with a underline, Letter and a number
